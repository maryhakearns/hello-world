# hello-world
My first repository–an introduction to the world of Git–created using the outline in https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world.
I created it as part of a Johns Hopkins R Programming Class offered through Coursera.
I love exploring data and finding the stories hidden within the numbers.
